These ACS scripts were written by RaveYard with help of Apoc9
(Except for "sqrt" and "distance")

If you wish to copy something out of it thou, contact me on Zandronum Forums telling me:
	1 - Which part you are going to copy?
	2 - Why are you going to copy it?
	3 - What is the name of your project? (becuz I am interested :D )

	And go ahead and copy it :D

(You do not have to wait for my response, just make sure you informed me about it!)
